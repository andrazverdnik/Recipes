            <li><h3>Butter and sugar </h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter (cooled to room temperature) and brown sugar (used in these cookies in a small refrigerator) to empty the electric bucket. Run at half speed for about 3 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Eggs, vanilla </h3><p>Add the butter and vanilla sugar mixture to the eggs and vanilla extract or bean paste. Mix in a mixing bowl. Simply move the blend shape at a time.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Add dry </h3><p>Add white flour, a teaspoon of Savinkulam baking powder and salt. Mix and send to connect quickly. It also ensures that it won't bother you for long. Or add some chocolate chips and mix thoroughly like a spatula.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Cookies </h3><p>It covers the baking area and is covered with a large sheet of baking paper to bake the cone mixture or the ice cream mixture. We need about 22 USD. Place the mixture in the refrigerator for 15 to 30 minutes to set.</p></li>
            <li><h3>We are getting ready </h3><p>Turn the pasta into a beautiful ball. When you reach the bottom of the pan (wrapped in parchment paper), lightly touch it. All you have to do is bring the cookies in by inserting a slot between them and spread them out during the baking process. Bake in a preheated oven at 11 Â° C for 9 minutes, until 175 is too much for a biscuit. When brown is cooked. Pieces of chocolate with pastries were brought to the royal refrigerator.</p></li>

        <p>If that's not all, if they bake American cookies at the same time, they can freeze them for 60 days in just three years.</p>
