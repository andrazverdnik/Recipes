    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><p><h3>Season the chicken</h3></p>Generously sprinkle the fajita seasoning on both sides of the chicken and use your fingers to press it in.</li>
            <li><p><h3>Cook the chicken</h3></p>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and lightly coat it with a drizzle of olive oil or avocado oil. Sear the chicken breasts for about 7-8 minutes on each side. Then remove them from the pan and let them rest for a few minutes before slicing into strips.</li>
            <li><p><h3>Saute the bell peppers and onion</h3></p>While the chicken is cooking, cut the bell peppers and onions into thin slices. Then saute them in the same skillet over medium heat for a few minutes until caramelized. You're essentially making fajita veggies.</li>
            <li><p><h3>Mix together</h3></p>Add the chicken back into the skillet, squeeze fresh lime juice on top and stir everything together.</li>
            <li><p><h3>Wrap it up</h3></p>Serve immediately with tortillas and extra toppings.</li>
        </ol>
